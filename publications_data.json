    "abstract": "Stress is one of the most significant health problems in the 21st century, and should be dealt with due to the costs of primary and secondary cares of stress-associated psychological and psychiatric problems. In this study, the brain network states exposed to stress were monitored based on electroencephalography (EEG) measures extracted by complex network analysis. To this regard, 23 healthy male participants aged 18–28 were exposed to a stress test. EEG data and salivary cortisol level were recorded for three different conditions including before, right after, and 20 min after exposure to stress. Then, synchronization likelihood (SL) was calculated for the set of EEG data to construct complex networks, which are scale reduced datasets acquired from multi-channel signals. These networks with weighted connectivity matrices were constructed based on original EEG data and also by using four different waves of the recorded signals including δ, θ, α, and β. In addition to these networks with weighted connectivity, networks with binary connectivity matrices were also derived using threshold T. For each constructed network, four measures including transitivity, modularity, characteristic path length, and global efficiency were calculated. To select the sensitive optimal features from the set of the calculated measures, compensation distance evaluation technique (CDET) was applied. Finally, multi-class support vector machine (SVM) was trained in order to classify the brain network states. The results of testing the SVM models showed that the features based on the original EEG, α and β waves have got better performances in monitoring the brain network states.",

    "abstract": "Nonlocal continuum mechanics is a popular growing theory for investigating the dynamic behavior of Carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Estimating the nonlocal constant is a crucial step in mathematical modeling of CNTs vibration behavior based on this theory. Accordingly, in this study a vibration-based nonlocal parameter estimation technique, which can be competitive because of its lower instrumentation and data analysis costs, is proposed. To this end, the nonlocal models of the CNT by using the linear and nonlinear theories are established. Then, time response of the CNT to impulsive force is derived by solving the governing equations numerically. By using these time responses the parametric model of the CNT is constructed via the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) method. The appropriate ARMA parameters, which are chosen by an introduced feature reduction technique, are considered features to identify the value of the nonlocal constant. In this regard, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network has been trained to construct the complex relation between the ARMA parameters and the nonlocal constant. After training the MLP, based on the assumed linear and nonlinear models, the ability of the proposed method is evaluated and it is shown that the nonlocal parameter can be estimated with high accuracy in the presence/absence of nonlinearity.",

For this purpose, the impulse response of the beam model, in the presence of added measurement noise, is obtained by solving the weak form of the governing equation of motion via Rayleigh–Ritz method. The non-linear interaction model (NIM) including a set of intrinsic modal oscillators (IMOs) is constructed based on intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), which are derived by applying empirical mode decomposition (EMD) on the noise-contaminated response signals. For reducing the effect of noise and increasing the accuracy of extracted IMFs, the EMD-based noise reduction is employed, followed by the modification of the IMF amplitudes by introducing a “beta-factor” criterion. The changes in the amplitudes of the forcing functions associated with IMOs are used to extract features to estimate the non-linear parameter of the system. To this end, an artificial neural network has been trained to establish the non-linear relationship between the non-linearity of the system and the forcing functions of IMOs.",

    "abstract": "Numerous engineering structures can be modeled as flexible beams carrying appendages. Physical time-dependent phenomena in such structures appear by considering nonlinear models. Accordingly, the free vibration of a nonlinear Rayleigh beam carrying a linear mass–spring–damper is investigated in this research. The nonlinearity is due to the axial stress changes, and the viscoelastic characteristic of the beam is described by the Kelvin–Voigt model. The governing nonlinear equations of motion are derived by using Hamilton’s principle and solved by the multiple scales method. The presence of the linear damper in the mass–spring–damper system causes a contradiction in the time response of the mass obtained from the classical procedure of the multiple scales method. Therefore, the problem is solved by some manipulations in the process of the multiple scales method. Then, the complex-valued resonance frequencies and mode-shapes are derived by applying the method of power series with the aid of Green function concept. Considering the solvability condition, the nonlinear time-dependent resonance frequencies and the vibration response are obtained. The stability of the solution is studied by using the forward and pullback attractor ideas. Finally, the vibration of the system involving 3:1 internal resonance is investigated, and the stability boundaries of the trivial and non-trivial steady-state solutions are derived based on Lyapunov’s first method. It is shown that the main parameters of the MSD can provide 3:1 internal resonance condition.",

For this purpose, the dimensionless equations governing the vibration of the system are analyzed based on multiple scales method. By considering viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt damping in the beam, complex mode shapes and time-dependent resonance frequencies are extracted. Using the traditional form of the multiple scales method results in physical contradiction in the time response of the concentrated mass, which should be resolved. After free vibration analysis, the forced response of the system under harmonic force with frequency close to the first natural frequency and occurrence of one-to-three internal resonance is studied. The parameters of the one degree of freedom system are considered in a way that the modal interaction occurs via internal resonance mechanism. In this condition, frequency response of the system and its stability are investigated and it is shown that the instability associated with the jump and Hopf bifurcation occurs in the vibration amplitude. Plots of the time response, phase and Poincare show that periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic vibration may take place in the system. In order to verify the present paper’s results, the natural frequencies of the system are compared to those of the previous studies; in addition to this comparison, the frequency response based on numerical integration validates the results of the present paper.",

    "abstract": "Imperfections that unavoidably occur during the fabrication process of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have a significant influence on the vibration behavior of CNTs. Among these imperfections, the boundary condition defect is studied in this investigation based on the nonlocal elasticity theory. To this end, a mathematical model of the non-ideal end condition in a cantilever CNT is developed by a strongly non-linear spring to study its effect on the vibration behavior. The weak form equation of motion is derived via Hamilton’s principle and solved based on Rayleigh–Ritz approach. Once the frequency response function (FRF) of the CNT is simulated, it is found that the defect parameter injects noise to the FRF in the range of lower frequencies and as a result the small scale effect on the FRF remains undisturbed in high frequency ranges. Besides, in this work a process is introduced to estimate the nonlocal and defect parameters for establishing the mathematical model of the CNT based on FRF, which can be competitive because of its lower instrumentation and data analysis costs. The estimation process relies on the resonance frequencies and the magnitude of noise in the frequency response function of the CNT. The results show that the constructed dynamic response of the system based on estimated parameters is in good agreement with the original response of the CNT.",

Then, the derived equations are solved via Rung-Kutta method and the simulated response of the beam to impulse force is obtained. By contaminating the simulated response to artificial measurement noise, nonparametric nonlinear system identification is applied to reconstruct the response. Accordingly, intrinsic mode functions of the response are obtained by using advanced empirical mode decomposition, and nonlinear interaction model including intrinsic modal oscillators is constructed. Primary results show that the presence of noise in the response highly affects the sifting process which results in extraction of spurious intrinsic mode functions. In order to eradicate the effect of noise on this process, noise signals are used as masking signals in the advanced empirical mode decomposition method and intrinsic mode functions corresponding to the noise are extracted. Based on this approach, the dynamic of the noise in the response is identified and noise reduced signals are reconstructed by the intrinsic modal oscillators with suitable accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays investigating the vibration behavior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has drawn considerable attention due to the superior mechanical properties of the CNTs. One of the powerful theoretical methods to study the vibration behavior of CNTs is implementing the nonlocal theory. Most of studies on the vibration behavior of CNTs have assumed a fixed value for small scale parameter for all vibration modes, however, this value is mode-dependent. Therefore, in this paper, the small scale parameter is calibrated for a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) with respect to each vibration mode. For this propose, the governing equation of motion based on the nonlocal beam theory is extracted by applying the Hamilton's principle. Then, by using the power series method, an eigenvalue problem is defined to derive the calibrated value of small scale constant and nonlocal mode shapes of the CNT. By using the expansion theory, the equation of motion is discretized, and the effect of nonlocality on the modal parameters and stability of the CNT under compressive force is investigated. Finally, the possibility of estimating nonlocal parameter based on simulated frequency domain response of the system by using modal analysis methods is studied. The results show that the calibration of small scale constant is important and the critical axial force is highly sensitive to this value.",

By considering a suitable parameter, the governing equation is converted to a form which can be solved by the perturbation method. Applying the Lindstedt-Poincare’ method, the time response, the nonlinear resonance frequencies and the fluid critical velocity of the nanotube are obtained. The accuracy of the results is investigated by comparing them with those obtained through the numerical method. Unlike previous researches, the analytical relation for the fluid critical velocity is obtained considering the effect of the geometric nonlinearity. The results indicate that, as the fluid velocity increases and reaches a critical value, the time response amplitude grows without limit and the nanotube loses stability. Moreover, in comparison with the linear and small-amplitude vibrations of nanotube, by increasing the amplitude of oscillations, nonlinear behavior dominates and the instability occurs at a higher fluid velocity.",
