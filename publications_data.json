    "abstract": "There are many researches on the vibration behavior of the multi-phase flow in the pipes. However, there isn’t any general statistical study on the dynamic response of such systems. Therefore in this paper, at the first step, the nonlinear equation governing the transverse vibration of the pipe is derived using the Hamilton's principle. The nonlinearity in the system is induced by considering large deflections. The interaction between the pipe and the multi-phase fluid flow and the resultant uncertainty is modeled by random excitation which is produced by using normal distribution function. After extraction of the governing equation and discretizing it by the Galerkin method, the equations are solved numerically. The statistical parameters of the response have been extracted by Monte-Carlo simulation. With studying on the deflection of one point on the pipe and also considering corresponding upper and lower limit band (confidence interval), extended results of uncertainties effects have been obtained. The results show that with increasing the velocity of the fluid, the uncertainty of the response is decreasing. Also by considering nonlinear model, the probabilities of failure are increased.",

    "abstract": "The extraordinary properties of carbon nanotubes enable a variety of applications such as axially moving elements in nanoscale systems. For vibration analysis of axially moving nanoscale beams with time-dependent velocity, the small-scale effects could make considerable changes in the vibration behavior. In this research, by applying the nonlocal theory and considering small fluctuations in the axial velocity, the stability and non-linear vibrations of an axially moving nanoscale visco-elastic Rayleigh beam are studied. It is assumed that the non-linearity is geometric and is due to the axial stress changes. The energy loss in the system is considered by using the Kelvin–Voigt model. The governing higher order nonlocal equation of motion is derived by using Hamilton׳s principle and is analyzed by applying the multiple scales and power series methods. Then the non-linear resonance frequencies and response of the system are obtained. Considering the solvability condition, the stability of the system is studied parametrically through Lyapunov׳s first method. An interesting result is that, considering the small-scale effects changes the slope of the frequency response curves due to the fluctuations in the axial velocity, considerably.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) has been implemented for modeling and reducing CO and NOx emissions from a direct injection dual-fuel engine. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network is developed to predict the values of the emissions based on experimental data. The controllable variables such as engine speed, output power, intake temperature, mass flow rate of diesel fuel, and mass flow rate of the gaseous fuel are considered as input parameters. In order to identify the uncertainties due to the experiments and the ANN-based model, uncertainty analysis is carried out. Finally, optimum values of intake temperature, mass flow rate of diesel and gaseous fuels are obtained for a desired output power and engine speed via NSGA-II. The use of the developed evolutionary optimization algorithm allows the calculation of the Pareto-optimal set of designs under any combination of engine speed and output power, defined in the range of the experiments.",
