            In this project, studies are conducted to develop a new reduced-order modeling approach to 
            investigate the nonlinear vibrations of rotating pre-twisted blades with variations in thickness and 
            chord length, based on nonlinear centrifugal effects.
            </br>
            To ensure reliable, efficient, and economical design of rotating equipment, high-fidelity model and solution methodology are developed for
            analyzing mechanical vibrations of the system, addressing the challenges of balancing accuracy
            and efficiency in dynamic modeling. Unlike simplified models that neglect key effects like Coriolis
            forces or steady-state equilibrium deformations (SSEDs), the proposed approach incorporates 
            rotation-induced force fields, geometric complexities (e.g., pre-set and pre-twist angles,
            thickness, and chord length variations), and nonlinear dynamics. Using a two-dimensional 
            nonlinear spectral solution method and one-to-one mapping, the model achieves computational
            efficiency and accuracy, validated through finite element simulations. Additionally, a novel
            model order reduction followed by multi-harmonic harmonic balance method is developed to explore
            primary and internal resonances. The resulting model enables precise predictions of vibration behavior,
            facilitating the economical and reliable design of blades for various rotating equipment applications.
